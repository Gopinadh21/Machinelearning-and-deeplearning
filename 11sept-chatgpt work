Day 1: Understanding the Basics of Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Objective: Gain a foundational understanding of machine learning and deep learning, including basic concepts, types, and key terminology.

1. Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)
What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
Example: Predicting house prices based on features like location, size, and number of rooms.
Types of Machine Learning:

Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs). It learns to map inputs to outputs.
Example: Predicting a house price based on features.
Unsupervised Learning: The model is trained on unlabeled data and must find patterns or structure in the input data.
Example: Customer segmentation based on purchase behavior.
Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on actions taken.
Example: A robot learning to navigate a maze.
Basic Terminology:

Model: The system or algorithm that makes predictions or decisions based on input data.
Feature: An individual measurable property of the data (e.g., age, height, etc.).
Label: The output or result that the model is trying to predict (e.g., house price).
Training: The process of teaching the model to learn patterns from the data.
Testing: Evaluating the model’s performance on unseen data.
2. Introduction to Deep Learning (DL)
What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in data.
Example: Image recognition, where a deep learning model can identify objects like cats, dogs, cars, etc.
Difference Between ML and DL:

ML: Often involves simpler models like linear regression, decision trees, etc., and can work well with structured data.
DL: Typically requires large amounts of data and computational power. It's more suitable for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, etc.
Neural Networks:

Neurons: Basic units of a neural network, similar to brain neurons. Each neuron receives input, processes it, and passes it to the next layer.
Layers: Neural networks are made up of layers of neurons. The most common types are:
Input Layer: Receives the initial data.
Hidden Layers: Intermediate layers where the actual processing happens.
Output Layer: Produces the final prediction or decision.
3. Key Resources for Learning
Videos and Lectures:

Coursera’s “What is Machine Learning?” (30 mins): Introduction to ML, great for beginners.
DeepLizard’s “Deep Learning Fundamentals” playlist on YouTube: Covers deep learning basics, including neural networks and key concepts.
Reading Material:

“Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow” by Aurélien Géron: An excellent book to understand both ML and DL with practical examples.
Machine Learning Yearning by Andrew Ng: A free guide that helps you structure ML projects.
4. Practical Exercises
Explore a Simple ML Example:

Use Python to implement a basic linear regression model.
Code Example:
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Example data (input: size of house, output: price)
X = np.array([[1500], [1700], [1800], [2000], [2200]])
y = np.array([300000, 340000, 360000, 400000, 430000])

# Creating and training the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predicting the price of a new house
new_house_size = np.array([[2100]])
predicted_price = model.predict(new_house_size)

print(f"Predicted price for 2100 sq ft house: ${predicted_price[0]:,.2f}")
Experiment with a Neural Network:

Use TensorFlow or PyTorch to create a simple neural network. You can start by building a neural network to classify images (e.g., MNIST dataset of handwritten digits).
5. Reflection and Summary
Summarize what you’ve learned today.
Write down any questions or topics you found challenging for further review.
Estimated Time Commitment:
Lectures/Videos: 2-3 hours.
Reading: 2 hours.
Hands-On Coding: 3 hours.
Make sure to take short breaks between learning sessions to stay fresh and absorb the material better. This foundational day is critical for understanding the more complex topics you'll encounter in the coming days.
